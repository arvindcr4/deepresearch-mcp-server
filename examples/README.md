# Atlas MCP Server Backup Example

This repository contains the `backup-example/` directory which demonstrates how Atlas MCP Server's backup functionality works.

## Overview

The backup feature allows you to export your project's knowledge and tasks into JSON format for external storage, sharing, or analysis. The example project in this directory shows what the output from running `npm run db:backup` looks like.

## Contents

The `backup-example/` directory contains:
- Sample task data exported in JSON format
- Example of how knowledge and context are stored
- Format of the backup files generated by the system

## How to Use the Backup Feature

To backup your own Atlas MCP Server data:

1. Navigate to your Atlas MCP Server project root directory
2. Run `npm run db:backup` in your terminal
3. Your data will be exported to a format similar to the examples in this directory

## Example Structure

The backup files include:
- `tasks.json`: Contains all project tasks with their metadata, status, and requirements
- Knowledge data with context and relationships
- Project configuration information

## Purpose

This example is provided to:
- Help users understand the structure of backed-up data
- Demonstrate the completeness of the backup feature
- Provide a reference for data restoration or migration

## Notes

The backup feature is designed for data portability and disaster recovery. Regular backups are recommended to ensure your project data is protected.
